# Portfolio Health
Whatever the use case you're thinking of (modernization, move to cloud, due diligence,...), having some insight into your portfolio's quality is always a good thing.
- Refactorings required by a cloud migration might as well be accompanied by health improvements.
- Bluntly put, terrible applications ported to the Cloud are still terrible. 
 
## Demographics
Our first stop is the *Portfolio Demographics* dashboard where we can see our overall technology breakdown.
Click anywhere on the pie chart to bring up the list of technologies, and then on any technology in the list to bring up the related applications:
![Technologies Overview](/images/PortfolioHealth-1.png)
Just starting here with our modernization project would be a good place to ask the following questions:
- What are we doing with orphaned technologies like *Ruby* and *Scala*? Do we have a plan to migrate them... or to phase them out?
- What is our strategy for those big *COBOL* monoliths? Which ones aren't as sturdy as we'd like? Are they important to us?

And that's only the beginning... click on the ***Back to Dashboard*** button in the top right to see the other dimensions we can explore here:

Those are all the demographics broken down by the answers to each survey question. Go ahead and try to answer the following questions:
- How many applications are being developed by teams of extremely inexperienced people? 
	- Which one of those apps has the highest *Business Impact*?
	- Isn't that a bit worrying?
- How many ERPs are we using?
	- Which one has the highest maintenance cost?

Questions like this naturally arise when looking at such pie charts and they open the door to asking *"Do we need all those apps? Isn't there some redundancy there?"*. Only you can answer that, but Highlight can probably help you after you go to the main menu up there and, under ***DASHBOARDS***, choose ***Application Categories***.

Notice that you can get this kind of breakdown for any survey question (see the selector in the top right). This should definitely help with ***Portfolio Rationalization***.

## Another Decision Matrix
