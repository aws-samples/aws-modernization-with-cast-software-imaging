# Open-Source Safety

## Divide and Conquer
When it comes to managing the risks of using of Open Source, the primary user of insights may differ for security vulnerabilities (infosec and development teams), license risk (legal and compliance teams) or technology obsolescence (development and maintenance teams).

Prioritization is also extremely important, especially when considering that many development teams are currently inundated – if not submerged – by information on Open Source vulnerabilities, licensing issues or deprecated components. While remediations are often a good course of action for an application, managers and executives may want to take a step back and rationalize time-intensive tasks. Taking into account, for instance, whether an application is publicly accessible or critical to the business helps make more informed decisions on how best to utilize limited resources for remediation.
