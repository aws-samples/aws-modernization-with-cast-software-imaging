# The Cloud Journey

{{% notice info %}}
While following this workshop, you might notice some slight discrepancies between the screenshots shown here and the data you discover within the CAST Highlight web application. This is no cause for concern as our platform is regularly updated with new features and portfolio demographics are constantly being refreshed (for instance new CVEs are discovered and integrated every day, which might alter the OSS score of an application).

## The 5Rs
Imagine if you could click a button and instantly get all the necessary tasks to complete in the next 3 years to succeed in your career, your personal life or to win the lottery. Black magic? Yet, this is similar to what the new ***Portfolio Advisor for Cloud*** achieves for organizations that are assessing an application portfolio for cloud migration. Based on a multi-dimensional analysis of CAST Highlight’s ***Software Intelligence*** insights, a simple click calculates the recommended *Cloud migration segment* for each application in a portfolio.

### What are they?

The five Portfolio Advisor for Cloud segments are defined as follows:
- ***Rehost***: A recommendation to change the infrastructure configuration of the application in order to “Lift & Shift” it to the cloud using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- ***Refactor***: A recommendation to perform modest modifications of the application code without changing the architecture or functionality so that it can be migrated to the cloud in a container using Container as a Service (CaaS) or using Platform as a Service (PaaS).
- ***Rearchitect***: A recommendation to dramatically modify the application code thereby altering the architecture to improve the health of the application and enable it to be migrated to the cloud using Platform as a Service (PaaS) or deployed serverless using Function as a Service (FaaS).
- ***Rebuild***: A recommendation to discard the code of the application and develop it again in the cloud using Platform as a Service (PaaS) or serverless using Function as a Service (FaaS).
- ***Retire***: A recommendation to discard the application altogether or potentially replace it with a commercial Software as a Service (SaaS) alternative.

You can search for our two apps in the list below to find what recommendation they received:

### How the choice is made
For each application having scan results, CAST Highlight blends relevant Software Intelligence insights, weights, and benchmarks together to determine the recommended segment. Here are the indicators the Portfolio Advisor for Cloud uses to establish the segmentation recommendations:
- ***Business Impact*** scores (from the Business Impact survey)
- ***CloudReady*** scores and benchmarks (Blocker and Booster patterns)
- ***CloudReady Estimated Effort*** (to remediate Blockers)
- ***Software Health*** scores and benchmarks (Resiliency, Agility, Elegance)
- ***Open Source Safety*** scores and benchmarks (vulnerabilities, license risk, obsolescence)

### Making waves
Unless you clearly understand the boundaries and technical interactions of each of your applications across your entire portfolio, it is a real challenge to consolidate the various software links, especially when you have hundreds or even thousands of apps. However, anticipating and estimating the impact of a change in the application landscape is key, whatever the use case you’re currently handling (Cloud migration, application modernization, software resiliency heatmap, etc.)
In the top menu's ***DASHBOARDS***, choose ***Application Links*** to explore the relationships declared between the apps:

Selecting applications you intend to migrate, you can immediately see which ones are in their adhenrence and might be impacted by the next wave of migrations.
