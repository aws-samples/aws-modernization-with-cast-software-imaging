# Modernization Workshop

You will now go through three modernization scenarios:

- Scenario 1 – you will identify whether the data access layer could be isolated and replaced with a new data access solution (Horizontal partitioning)

- Scenario 2 – you will consider modernizing the local user authentication by replacing it with an Amazon authentication service

- Scenario 3 – you will create a functional grouping for the logging feature, gathering components which can be replaced by a dedicated Logging Service such as Amazon CloudWatch.
