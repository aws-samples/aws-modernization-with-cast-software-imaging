Within CAST Imaging there is the ability to run ad-hoc queries against the CAST Imaging internal database. 

Cypher Queries can be accessed through the “Search” menu using “CYPHER”  

Using Cypher queries requires knowledge on the Neo4j DBMS and its query language.  

Note: The internal structure of the CAST Imaging database could change from release to release  

Note: CAST Professional Services may be able to assist with specific queries or requirements for action lists
