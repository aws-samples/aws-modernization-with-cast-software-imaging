# Workshop Wrap-up 

## What did we learn


- CAST Imaging can support Application Refactoring and Modernization by providing in a few clicks visibility on the system architecture.

- Technical documentation based on the actual application source code can be created, saved, updated and shared through interactive graphs and custom comments and tags.

- CAST Imaging helps understand which source code components need to be investigated/changed as part of the transformation tasks and which call paths will need to be tested.

- CAST Imaging allows to create custom views of the existing/future application architecture using *Custom Aggregations* and vizualize the adherence with other parts of the application .

- CAST Imaging proposes several extraction formats (images, metadata into CSV, Excel, JSON).
