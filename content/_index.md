![CAST Logo](/images/CAST_Logo.png) 

## Accelerate the Modernization of a Portfolio of Applications to AWS, and on AWS 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use CAST Highlight to automatically and accurately analyze the cloud readiness of a portfolio of hundreds of custom applications of any technology in a week. This applies to both applications that still run on-premise or have been lifted-and-shifted to AWS, Google or Azure already, helping you to determine how to migrate & modernize them on AWS in a rapid and safe way. 

Beyond the initial assessment, you will also learn how to leverage CAST Highlight to track progress of your journey-to-cloud program throughout its lifetime, and continuously analyze the open source safety and software health of your entire portfolio over time, as applications keep getting modernized and evolve further. 

## Workshop Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to: 
- Onboard custom applications into CAST Highlight by scanning the static, on-premise application source code without touching the applications in production
- Navigate and extract relevant insights automatically generated by CAST Highlight on Cloud Readiness, Open Source Safety and Software Health, at both the portfolio and application levels
- Identify cloud migration Blockers in each application and estimate effort to remove them 
- Identify recommended AWS services 
- Support your journey-to-cloud program 

## Workshop Agenda 

1. Introduction 
2. Onboard 2 sample applications into a CAST Highlight sandbox 
3. Interpret insights automatically generated by CAST Highlight on the 2 applications 
4. Interpret insights automatically generated by CAST Highlight on a pre-loaded sample portfolio of 200+ applications 
5. Learn how to manage your migration & modernization program continuously using CAST Highlight 

Plan on taking about 1.5 hours to complete the full workshop.
