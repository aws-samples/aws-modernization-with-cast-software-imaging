# Application Modernization with CAST Imaging

## Navigate the inner structure of critical applications to accelerate and secure the modernization 

CAST Imaging reverse-engineers all database structures, code components, and interdependencies in complex software systems, down to the tiniest details. CAST Imaging creates accurate, interactive architecture blueprints allowing you to navigate through a complex system, perform precise analysis of the software structure, and make better decisions on application architecture. 

CAST Imaging automatically understands the technology stack, application layers, and adherence between the components with 5 levels of granularity - from abstracted services to object level granularity. Thanks to the generation of the application end-to-end transactions, you can quickly view the entire flow starting from UI, traversing through several intermediate layers and ending in the database - and reverse. CAST Imaging acts like a technical knowledge base of your application, providing search capabilities, tagging to retrieve specific objects using keywords, regrouping features to create functional views above the technical objects or design your to-be architecture and understand the bridges and gaps to be handled. CAST Imaging also provides visibility of the adherence between applications : API calls, shared data, etc. 

CAST Imaging is crucial for critical applications in Rearchitect or Refactor scenarios when migrating to the Cloud to  
- Rapidly understand the AS-IS structure of an application 
- Identify the transformation hurdles in the code 
- Plan and estimate the impact of the cloud migration scenarios such as fixing a Cloud blocker, integrating an AWS Cloud Service or carving out a legacy part of the application and create new bridges, etc. 
- Centralize the technical knowledge and share the vision with the rest of the team 

## Workshop Objectives 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use CAST Imaging to navigate the technical architecture of custom applications, helping you to determine how to migrate & modernize them on AWS in a rapid and safe way. 

Beyond the initial assessment, you will also learn how to leverage CAST Imaging to secure the natural evolution of your custom applications by providing an up-to-date technical knowledge base of the application code. 

## Workshop Agenda 

1. How CAST Imaging works 
2. ...

Plan on taking about 2 hours to complete the full workshop.
