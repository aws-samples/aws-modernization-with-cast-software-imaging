## Accelerate the Modernization of a Portfolio of Applications to AWS, and on AWS 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use CAST Highlight to automatically and accurately measure the cloud readiness of a portfolio of hundreds of custom applications of any technology in a week whether they still run on-premise or have been lifted-and-shifted to AWS, Google or Azure already, helping you to determine how to migrate & modernize them on AWS in a rapid and safe way. 

Beyond the initial assessment, you will also learn how to leverage CAST Highlight to track progress of your journey-to-cloud program throughout its lifetime, and continuously check for open source safety and software health of your entire portfolio over time, as applications keep getting modernized and evolve further. 

## Workshop Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to: 
- Onboard custom applications on CAST Highlight by scanning the application source code while leaving it on premises and not touching the applications in production 
- Navigate and extract relevant insights automatically generated by CAST Highlight on Cloud Readiness, Open Source Safety and Software Health, at portfolio level and application level 
- Identify cloud blockers in each app and effort estimates to remove them 
- Identify recommended AWS services 
- Support your journey-to-cloud program 

## Workshop Agenda 

1. Introduction 
2. Onboard 2 sample applications on CAST Highlight sandbox
