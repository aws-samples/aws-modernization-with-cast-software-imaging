# Modernize non-native architectures with CAST Imaging

![CAST Logo](/images/CAST_Logo.png) 

## Navigate the inner structure of critical applications to accelerate and secure the modernization 

CAST Imaging reverse-engineers database structures, code components, and interdependencies in complex software systems, down to the tiniest details into interactive maps. CAST Imaging creates accurate, interactive architecture blueprints allowing you to navigate through a complex system, perform precise analysis of the software structure, and make better decisions on application architecture. 

CAST Imaging automatically understands the technology stack, application layers, and adherence between the components with 5 levels of granularity - from abstracted services to object level granularity. Thanks to the generation of the application end-to-end transactions, you can quickly view the entire flow starting from UI, traversing through several intermediate layers and ending with the database. 

CAST Imaging acts like a technical knowledge base of your application providing: search capabilities ; documentation features to enrich the technical objects with user comments ; tagging feature to attach keywords to technical objects ; aggregation features to create functional views above the technical objects or design your to-be architecture and understand the bridges and gaps to be handled etc. 

CAST Imaging also provides visibility of the adherence between applications: API calls, shared data, etc. 

## Workshop Objectives 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use CAST Imaging to navigate the technical architecture of custom applications, helping you to determine how to integrate AWS services in a rapid and safe way.
