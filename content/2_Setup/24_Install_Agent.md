# Installing the Agent

As a ***SaaS*** product, **CAST Highlight** doesn't require any web server to run on your environment to display your portfolio results. However, its goals are also to be ***non-intrusive*** and to ensure that your confidential information never leaves your company's premises.

To that end, we will be performing the actual analysis of the applications' source code locally and we'll upload the results of the scan to the SaaS portal, which only contains meta-data.

## Downloading the Agent

From the ***Application Scans*** page you can simply click on the **Download Agent** button and save the agent on your machine.

## Installation process
The file *CastHighlightSetup.exe* can be executed and will enable you to choose a Language (we'll go with English here) for the setup wizard. You can
- Click on ***Next***
- Read the agreement and select the *"I accept the agreement"* option
- Select an installation folder (as you can see, the agent doesn't take much space)
- Select a *Start Menu* folder
- Choose whether or not to create *Desktop* and *Quick Launch* icons
- And finally monitor the installation's progress (it shouldn't take more than a couple minutes)
... and you're set.
