# Scanning Applications

## How do we extract our intel? 

In this section, we are going to perform the extraction of software intelligence from some custom applications. We intend to show you the process the way it's actually carried out for real customer engagements. Don't worry - it's actually very straightforward. 

Before we can get to the part where you get all the valuable insight about our applications, we have some setting up to do. Here's the plan:

- Register as a CAST Highlight user
- Grab a couple apps that we want to analyze
- Download and launch the analyzer
- Upload the results into the SaaS platform.
