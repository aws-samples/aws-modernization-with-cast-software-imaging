# Submitting Results

The "technical" work is now done. The ***CAST Highlight Agent*** has done its job and produced scan results for both applications and we're going to enter those into our portfolio.

Let's go back to the CAST Highlight web application and click on the ***APPLICATION SCANS*** menu. Our campaign is still pending:

## Uploading the Code Scan Results

Pick one of the apps and click on the ***Upload Results*** button. You'll be prompted to either browse for the results file or drag-and-drop it. Once that's done you'll see that the interface processes the data and is satisfied.

Close that dialog and you'll see that the code scan results are now ready for submitting:

But we're not done yet: we also need to capture some basic non-technical information about the application. Click on the ***Survey 0/2*** button.

## Filling-in the Surveys
The surveys we activated during the campaign creation are pretty straightforward. There's a whole more than can be done through surveys but here we'll contend with the basics so you can see how it works. You have two surveys to fill:
- ***Application Properties***
- ***Business Impact***

The answers you provide don't really matter for this workshop, but you'll see that they do have an impact on the way the applications are considered afterwards.

Here we went with making this application quite important for the company:

And once the answers are saved, we can click on the ***Submit*** button and let the interface work its magic.

While it does that, you should repeat the process with the second application so that the campaign is wrapped-up.
### Onto the results consumption
Now that we have performed the scans and uploaded the results, we can get to the nice part: getting insight from them...
