# Summary  

## Identify the micro-service candidate faster with CAST Imaging 

By getting a deep understanding of the application data, logic and user-interface, CAST Imaging has helped identifying a good candidate for the first microservice transformation:  
- Business critical functionality 
- Valuable API to be exposed to other applications 
- Loosely coupled data 
- Well-defined service boundaries (required data for the service) 

Structural flaws impacting performance have been detected in the legacy service to remediate when rewriting.
